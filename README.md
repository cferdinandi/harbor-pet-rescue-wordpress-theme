- Shortcodes to easily add button links, PayPal donation buttons, and dynamic image galleries anywhere on your site.
- The ability to add a custom logo.

## Optimized for impact

Harbor was built to maximize the impact of your animal rescue website.

- **It's built for mobile.** Mobile-friendly websites generate more revenue than desktop-only sites&mdash;even when someone visits from a desktop computer. Harbor works on any device with a web connection.
- **It's built for speed.** If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, you could be losing around half of your visitors. Delays of just half a second can cause meaningful decreases in revenue. Harbor was built to get content in front of your supporters as quickly as possible.
- **It's built for animal rescue.** Easily add a high-impact donation form with PayPal support. Show of your adoptable animals with interactive image galleries and Petfinder integration. Inspire potential donors with beautiful, full-width header images.

***Note:*** *to maximize website speed and performance, I'd strongly recommend installing the free [ZenCache plugin](http://zencache.com/).*
